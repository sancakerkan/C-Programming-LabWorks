The oldest settlements in the city center of Ankara belonged to the Hattic civilization which existed during the Bronze Age.
The city grew significantly in size and importance under the Phrygians starting around 1000 BC.
In Phrygian tradition King Midas was venerated as the founder of Ancyra but Pausanias mentions that the city was actually far older.
Phrygian rule was succeeded first by Lydian and later by Persian rule.
